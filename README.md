# 🧩 ShaguTweaks — ClassicAPI

A lightweight fork of [ShaguTweaks](https://github.com/shagu/ShaguTweaks) for the **Project Legacy Server**.

Focused on **stability, compatibility and performance** while keeping the original ShaguTweaks experience.

> This fork requires ClassicAPI and targets **Project Legacy Server server/client environments**.

## 🔌 Requirements

- **[ClassicAPI](https://github.com/brues-code/ClassicAPI) — required**
- **[SuperWoW](https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperWoW) — optional / recommended**

ClassicAPI is the main API layer. SuperWoW is only used as an additional fallback for some cast/GUID information.

## 📦 Installation

1. Install **ClassicAPI**.
2. Optionally install **SuperWoW**.
3. Rename the addon folder to `ShaguTweaks`.
4. Copy it to `World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\ShaguTweaks`.
5. Restart the game.

Settings: **Esc → Advanced Options**.

## ✨ Main changes

- ClassicAPI-backed integration for casts, auras, items and unit data.
- Reduced per-frame work, tooltip scans and repeated UI updates.
- Event-driven target and nameplate castbars where possible.
- Safer GUID-based handling for same-name enemies.
- Better Turtle WoW-like server compatibility for custom items, spells and UI changes.
- Safer hooks and fewer destructive global overrides.
- Expanded Item Rarity Borders support for merchant, quest, mail, trade, crafting and loot frames.
- Added independent Item Rarity Glows using the shared item rarity engine.
- Expanded Movable Unit Frames to handle Player, Target, Party, Minimap, Buffs, Debuffs and Weapon Buffs through one shared Ctrl+Shift mover and alignment grid.
- Restored Real Health Numbers as an independent module, with direct values when available and a lazy Vanilla health estimator fallback for percentage-only targets.
- Unit Frame Big Health is presentation-only again and no longer forces numeric health/power text.
- Various stability fixes across legacy ShaguTweaks modules.
